A desktop WPF application called Cybersecurity Awareness Assistant was created to inform users about cybersecurity best practices in an entertaining and interactive manner.  With a professional dark-themed UI and speech integration to greet users, it blends several features into one cohesive experience: a conversational chatbot, a quiz module, a task organizer with reminders, an activity log, and a graphically coded logo.

When the application first launches, it asks the user for their name using voice output. This information is then stored for customized responses throughout the chat.  With a symbolic shield and checkmark to symbolize digital safety and trust, the application's top features a visually appealing logo made with WPF shapes and paths .

The core of the application is the chatbot component.  Through string manipulation and simulated Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, it facilitates adaptable, human-like dialogue.  Users can ask questions or give commands in numerous  ways, such as "Remind me to update my password tomorrow" or "Add a task to enable two-factor authentication." By identifying key terms like "remind," "task," "phishing," "password," or "safe browsing," the bot can determine the user's intent.  It remembers and maintains user interests, offers topic-specific instructional recommendations that change, and reacts to emotional indicators like "I'm frustrated" or "I'm  worried" with encouraging words and useful advise.

The Task Manager tab, which shows tasks and reminders, is also integrated with the chatbot.  Adding tasks can be done manually with the chatbot.  The system records the reminder and saves it for later use if a user states a date   All open tasks are shown in a listbox, and buttons let users manually add or remove tasks

A multiple-choice cybersecurity test is offered by the Quiz Module. It presents questions with selected responses, provides feedback upon submission (whether correct or not), shows the right response along with an explanation, and has a progress bar and restart option to monitor learning progress

A timeline of user actions, including added tasks, finished quiz answers, and chatbot interactions, is recorded in the Activity Log. It maintains a running history for review 

The app's design mimics a computing console by using a dark green on black color scheme and the monospaced "Consolas" font. Users can simply browse between sections thanks to the tab-based structure and straightforward layout, while the graphic logo and heading at the top
Significant advancements were made during development, such as replacing image files with a dynamic XAML-based logo, incorporating voice-based greetings, improving the chatbot with string-based natural language processing (NLP) detection, making sure the chatbot always displays the help menu, tracking user interests with rotating tips, identifying sentiment words to respond sympathetically, connecting chatbot commands to actual task management, and enabling the quiz feature to provide visual feedback for correct answer explanations.
